# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines critical infrastructure and reliability improvements for the CodeRed platform. The initiative focuses on making the system production-ready through serverless optimization, resilient AI integration, rate limiting, health monitoring, and comprehensive testing. These changes address scalability, reliability, and maintainability concerns while ensuring the system can handle production workloads safely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Serverless-Safe Database Client

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the Supabase client to be optimized for serverless environments, so that database connections are efficiently reused across Lambda invocations and cold starts don't impact performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a single, globally cached Supabase client instance
2. WHEN multiple API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL reuse the same client instance across invocations
3. WHEN running in TEST_MODE THEN the system SHALL allow mock clients without throwing configuration errors
4. WHEN production environment lacks required credentials THEN the system SHALL throw clear error messages
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL provide a ping utility to verify database connectivity

### Requirement 2: Resilient AI Client with Fallback

**User Story:** As a learner using the platform, I want to receive nudge messages consistently even when AI services are temporarily unavailable, so that my learning experience isn't disrupted by external service failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI service calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN multiple consecutive failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
3. WHEN circuit breaker is open THEN the system SHALL return templated fallback messages immediately
4. WHEN running in TEST_MODE THEN the system SHALL return mock responses without calling external APIs
5. WHEN streaming is supported THEN the system SHALL provide streaming response capability
6. WHEN AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL generate personalized fallback messages using learner data

### Requirement 3: Rate Limiting Protection

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want API endpoints to be protected from abuse and excessive usage, so that system resources are preserved and costs are controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed 5 per minute per IP THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 status
2. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL include Retry-After header in response
3. WHEN using admin API key THEN the system SHALL apply rate limiting per key instead of IP
4. WHEN rate limit resets THEN the system SHALL allow requests to proceed normally
5. WHEN nudge endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting before processing

### Requirement 4: Health Monitoring Endpoint

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a comprehensive health check endpoint, so that I can monitor system status and dependencies without triggering expensive operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity
2. WHEN health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL check AI service configuration presence
3. WHEN all dependencies are healthy THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with status "ok"
4. WHEN any dependency fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 with status "degraded"
5. WHEN in TEST_MODE THEN the system SHALL return successful health status without external calls
6. WHEN health check runs THEN the system SHALL NOT consume AI API credits or quotas

### Requirement 5: Stable Test Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests to run reliably without animation-related flakiness, so that CI/CD pipelines are stable and test results are trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TEST_MODE is enabled THEN the system SHALL disable Framer Motion animations
2. WHEN Playwright tests run THEN the system SHALL have reduced motion for stable interactions
3. WHEN CI pipeline executes THEN the system SHALL automatically set TEST_MODE environment variable
4. WHEN animations are disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality without visual effects
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide consistent, repeatable results

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want comprehensive test coverage for critical system components, so that regressions are caught early and system reliability is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk computation edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL have unit tests covering all scenarios
2. WHEN AI service failures happen THEN the system SHALL have tests verifying fallback behavior
3. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL have integration tests confirming proper responses
4. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL have tests validating all status scenarios
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL have tests ensuring graceful error handling
6. WHEN all tests execute THEN the system SHALL pass in TEST_MODE environment

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Persistence

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want all nudge generation attempts to be logged with their outcomes, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nudges are generated successfully THEN the system SHALL persist records with source "gemini"
2. WHEN fallback templates are used THEN the system SHALL persist records with source "template"
3. WHEN streaming responses are sent THEN the system SHALL record streaming status in database
4. WHEN rate limiting blocks requests THEN the system SHALL log the blocking event
5. WHEN circuit breaker activates THEN the system SHALL record the activation and reason

### Requirement 8: Security and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want sensitive configuration to be properly managed without exposing secrets in the codebase, so that the system maintains security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any API keys or secrets
2. WHEN new environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL update .env.example with placeholders
3. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in non-test environments
4. WHEN TEST_MODE is active THEN the system SHALL work without requiring production credentials
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
