# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CodeRed Frontend is a Next.js 14 TypeScript application that provides a modern, accessible web interface for the CodeRed educational platform. The frontend integrates with the existing CodeRed backend API to deliver learner management capabilities, AI-powered nudging, and administrative functions. The application is inspired by upGrad's UX patterns while maintaining original branding and content, designed for serverless deployment on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to view a comprehensive dashboard of learner data, so that I can quickly identify at-risk students and monitor overall class performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a risk distribution chart showing learner risk levels
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show a list of top 5 at-risk learners with their risk scores
3. WHEN I apply risk filters (Low/Medium/High) THEN the system SHALL update the displayed learners accordingly
4. WHEN I search for learners by name or email THEN the system SHALL filter results with 300ms debouncing
5. WHEN I select multiple learners THEN the system SHALL enable bulk action capabilities
6. IF there are no learners matching filters THEN the system SHALL display a friendly empty state with actionable guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to generate personalized AI nudges for individual learners, so that I can provide timely intervention and motivation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Generate Nudge" for a learner THEN the system SHALL open a modal with streaming text display
2. WHEN the nudge generation starts THEN the system SHALL stream AI-generated content in real-time chunks
3. WHEN streaming is active THEN the system SHALL provide a cancel button that aborts the request
4. IF the backend returns JSON fallback THEN the system SHALL display the fallback content with appropriate visual indication
5. WHEN nudge generation completes THEN the system SHALL persist the nudge and show success feedback
6. IF streaming fails or times out THEN the system SHALL offer retry options with exponential backoff
7. WHEN a nudge is generated THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting to prevent spam (client-side throttle)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to view detailed learner profiles, so that I can understand individual student progress and engagement patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a learner card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed learner profile page
2. WHEN the learner detail page loads THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive learner information including progress metrics
3. WHEN the learner detail page loads THEN the system SHALL show a timeline of recent activities and quiz scores
4. WHEN viewing learner details THEN the system SHALL provide access to the nudge generation interface
5. WHEN learner data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time using React Query cache invalidation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to run bulk risk simulations, so that I can recompute risk scores for all learners when assessment criteria change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin page THEN the system SHALL provide a "Run Simulation" button
2. WHEN I click "Run Simulation" THEN the system SHALL display a progress modal showing processing status
3. WHEN simulation is running THEN the system SHALL disable the simulate button to prevent concurrent executions
4. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL show processed/updated counts and invalidate cached data
5. WHEN simulation fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and enable retry options
6. IF I try to run simulation too frequently THEN the system SHALL enforce cooldown periods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through large datasets efficiently, so that I can access all learner information without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learner lists exceed the page limit THEN the system SHALL implement cursor-based pagination
2. WHEN I scroll to the bottom of the learner list THEN the system SHALL automatically load more results (infinite scroll)
3. WHEN infinite scroll is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a manual "Load More" button as fallback
4. WHEN I change filters or search terms THEN the system SHALL cancel previous requests to prevent race conditions
5. WHEN pagination requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
6. WHEN loading additional data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate using keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide logical focus order and visible focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and live regions
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG AA color contrast requirements
4. WHEN modals are open THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the modal
5. WHEN streaming content updates THEN the system SHALL announce changes via ARIA live regions
6. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL provide accessible labels and descriptions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on various devices, I want the application to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile, so that I can access learner data from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN I access the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen space efficiently
3. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the navigation between horizontal links and burger menu
4. WHEN viewing cards on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and hover alternatives
5. WHEN using the application offline THEN the system SHALL display offline indicators and queue actions appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when network issues or server problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL display an offline banner with retry options
2. WHEN server returns 5xx errors THEN the system SHALL show friendly error messages with support contact options
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs (429) THEN the system SHALL respect retry-after headers and disable actions accordingly
4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. WHEN streaming requests are interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle partial content gracefully and offer recovery options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be maintainable and testable, so that the codebase can evolve reliably over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with strict typing for all components and functions
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow single-responsibility principles with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL be placed in lib/ directories separate from UI components
4. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL achieve comprehensive coverage of streaming logic, pagination, and error handling
5. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL pass all linting, type checking, and testing requirements
