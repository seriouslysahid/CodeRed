# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CodeRed Learner Engagement Platform backend is a serverless Next.js 14 application that provides API endpoints for managing learners and generating personalized nudges to improve engagement. The system uses Supabase as the database, Google Gemini for AI-powered nudge generation, and implements a risk scoring engine to identify at-risk learners. The backend is designed to be fully serverless, TypeScript-first, and production-ready for deployment on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, so that I can develop and deploy a type-safe serverless backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL provide a complete package.json with all required dependencies
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation is run THEN the system SHALL compile without errors using strict TypeScript configuration
3. WHEN the project is deployed to Vercel THEN the system SHALL route API requests correctly using vercel.json configuration
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a complete .env.example file documenting all required variables
5. WHEN code quality checks are run THEN the system SHALL pass ESLint and Prettier formatting rules

### Requirement 2: Database Integration and Management

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to connect to Supabase using admin privileges, so that I can perform all necessary database operations securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to Supabase using the service role key
2. WHEN multiple serverless functions run concurrently THEN the system SHALL reuse a single Supabase client instance via globalThis pattern
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors gracefully
4. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and return appropriate status

### Requirement 3: Learner Management API

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to manage learner records through REST API endpoints, so that I can create, read, update, and delete learner information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GET /api/learners is called THEN the system SHALL return paginated learner records with cursor-based pagination
2. WHEN POST /api/learners is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new learner record and compute initial risk score
3. WHEN GET /api/learners/[id] is called THEN the system SHALL return the specific learner record or 404 if not found
4. WHEN PUT /api/learners/[id] is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the learner record and recompute risk score
5. WHEN DELETE /api/learners/[id] is called with admin authorization THEN the system SHALL delete the learner record
6. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with detailed feedback
7. WHEN cursor pagination is used THEN the system SHALL return nextCursor for efficient pagination

### Requirement 4: Risk Assessment Engine

**User Story:** As the system, I want to automatically assess learner risk levels, so that I can identify students who need additional support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner record is created or updated THEN the system SHALL compute a risk score based on configurable weights
2. WHEN risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL use completion rate (40%), quiz performance (35%), missed deadlines (15%), and login frequency (10%) as default weights
3. WHEN risk score is computed THEN the system SHALL normalize the score to 0-1 range where higher scores indicate higher risk
4. WHEN risk score is determined THEN the system SHALL assign risk labels: low (<0.33), medium (0.33-0.66), high (>0.66)
5. WHEN environment variables are provided THEN the system SHALL allow overriding default risk calculation weights

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Nudge Generation

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the system to generate personalized nudges for learners, so that I can provide targeted interventions to improve engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POST /api/learners/[id]/nudge is called THEN the system SHALL attempt to generate a personalized nudge using Google Gemini
2. WHEN Gemini streaming is available THEN the system SHALL return a streaming response with real-time nudge generation
3. WHEN Gemini streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a template-based nudge generation
4. WHEN a nudge is generated THEN the system SHALL persist the nudge to the database with status and source information
5. WHEN nudge generation completes THEN the system SHALL return the generated text and indicate if fallback was used

### Requirement 6: Batch Processing and Simulation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to run batch operations to recompute risk scores for all learners, so that I can maintain accurate risk assessments at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POST /api/simulate is called THEN the system SHALL process learners in configurable chunks using cursor pagination
2. WHEN batch processing runs THEN the system SHALL be memory-safe and handle large datasets without timeout
3. WHEN simulation is executed THEN the system SHALL be idempotent and safe to run multiple times
4. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL return the number of learners processed and updated
5. WHEN optional limit parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL respect the limit for partial processing

### Requirement 7: Data Validation and Security

**User Story:** As a secure system, I want to validate all input data and protect admin operations, so that I can prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate all request bodies using Zod schemas
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with detailed validation messages
3. WHEN admin operations are requested THEN the system SHALL require x-admin-api-key header authentication
4. WHEN unauthorized admin access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized response
5. WHEN service role keys are used THEN the system SHALL keep them server-side only and never expose to client

### Requirement 8: Database Schema and Seeding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database tables and seed data, so that I can set up the system quickly for development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database setup is required THEN the system SHALL provide SQL scripts to create learners and nudges tables
2. WHEN tables are created THEN the system SHALL include appropriate indexes for performance optimization
3. WHEN seed script is run THEN the system SHALL insert diverse sample learner data for testing
4. WHEN seeding completes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate nudge generation and storage functionality

### Requirement 9: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive tests and CI/CD pipeline, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL test risk engine calculations with various scenarios
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test API endpoints with mocked database calls
3. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute linting, type checking, and all tests
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use mocked external services and not call real APIs
5. WHEN code quality checks run THEN the system SHALL pass all configured linting and formatting rules

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer or operator, I want clear documentation and deployment instructions, so that I can set up, run, and deploy the system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include complete setup instructions for local development
2. WHEN deployment guide is needed THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step Vercel deployment instructions
3. WHEN Google Cloud setup is required THEN the system SHALL document Gemini API configuration with service account recommendations
4. WHEN Supabase setup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide database migration and configuration steps
5. WHEN API testing is required THEN the system SHALL provide sample curl commands for all endpoints
